# Contributor Guide

I appreciate your interest in improving this project. This project is open-source under the [MIT license] and
welcomes contributions in the form of bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. Currently, our focus is on **improving documentation** and **hunting for bugs**.

We intend to use the [Issue Tracker] to coordinate the community and provide templates for bug reports, feature requests, documentation updates, and implementation improvements. So be sure to use the appropriate template with further instructions on writing any.

## Ressources

Here is a list of important resources for contributors:

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.9+ and the following tools:

- [Poetry]
- [Nox]
- [nox-poetry]

Install the package with development requirements:

```console
$ poetry install
```

You can now run an interactive Python session,
or the command-line interface:

```console
$ poetry run python
$ poetry run flask-jeroboam
```

[nox]: https://nox.thea.codes/
[nox-poetry]: https://nox-poetry.readthedocs.io/

## How to test the project

You will need pyenv installed with appropriate python versions available (currently: 3.8 to 3.11) and poetry. Before to run the nox session, you'll need to create a poetry environment for each python version. Unless you do that nox won't have all the python versioned environment to run against and will fail on unavailable verions.

```bash
pyenv local 3.11
poetry env use 3.11
poetry install --with dev

pyenv local 3.10
poetry env use 3.10
poetry install --with dev

pyenv local 3.9
poetry env use 3.9
poetry install --with dev
```

Then you can run all nox sessions:

```bash
nox
```

If you want to run a specific nox session, do:

```bash
nox --session "pre-commit"
```

Run the full test suite:

```console
$ nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```console
$ nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```console
$ nox --session=tests
```

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

```console
$ nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
