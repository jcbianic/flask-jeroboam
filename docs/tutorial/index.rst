Tutorial
========

This tutorial will walk you through creating a wine-tasting API with **Flask-Jeroboam**. We will focus on the specifics of **Flask-Jeroboam**, and will only touch on the general aspects of Flask as they are already excellent resources on the matter. If you're new to the latter, we can only recommend that you go over the `Flask Tutorial <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/tutorial/>`_, which is excellent and will put you on the right track. You will be in a much better place to appreciate what **Flask-Jeroboam** actually brings to the table and decide wether it's for you or not.

----------------

- Michael Grinberg's `Mega Tutorial <https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world>`_ is a must read. It's a great introduction to Flask and covers a lot of ground.
- `FastAPI Documentation <https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/>`_ is in my opinion a gold standard. It's very well written, and thorough and the examples are easy to follow. You should definitely check it out. It holds value even if you're not going to use FastAPI.
